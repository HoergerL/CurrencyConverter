# Currency Converter

#### created in April 2019

The Currency Converter converts the currencies
* Euro
* Singapore Dollars
* Pounds
* Indian Rupees

into each other by using a fixed exchange rate.

## how it works

In the MainActivity you see the two latest used currencies symbolized by their country's flags an with the currency name as a hint in the EditText, where you can type the number you want to convert. If you type a number, which is too small or too big it shows a warning.

If you click on one of the flags, the app opens the second activity named CurrencySelection, where the user can select another currency by clicking either on the flag or on the name of the currency. Then the second activity closes immediately and the chosen currency is shown in the MainActivity and can be used for the conversion.
Additionally there is a ColorPickerActivity where you can choose the text and the background color of the app.
